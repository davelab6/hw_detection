Hardware Detection scripts for KOC
------------------------------------

About half of the laptops donated to KOC at this time are Linux;  the other half are Windows.

We have two hardware detection scripts (one for each OS). 
KOC volunteers can run the appropriate script on laptops donated to the project, in order to quickly discover things like HD size and memory.
This should speed the 'triage' phase of the donation & distribution process.

Ideally, donators would be able to download the scripts themselves and determine if a laptop is a suitable candidate prior to donation.
